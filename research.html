<h2>Service Selection, and Composition</h2>
<p align="justify">The increasing momentum of service-oriented architecture has led to the emergence of divergent delivered services, where service selection is meritedly required to obtain the target service fulfilling the requirements from both users and service providers. Despite many existing works have extensively handled the issue of service selection, it remains an open question in the case where requests from multiple users are performed simultaneously by a certain set of shared candidate services. Meanwhile, there exist some constraints enforced on the context of service selection, e.g. service placement location and contracts between users and service providers. In this sense, we focus on the QoS-aware service selection with constraints from a fairness aspect, with the objective of achieving max-min fairness across multiple service requests sharing candidate service sets. To be more specific, we study the problem of fairly selecting services from shared candidate sets while service providers are self-motivated to offer better services with higher QoS values. We formulate this problem as a lexicographical maximization problem, which is far from trivial to deal with practically due to its inherently multi-objective and discrete nature. A fairness-aware algorithm for concurrent service selection is proposed, whose basic idea is to iteratively solve the single-objective subproblems by transforming them into linear programming problems. Experimental results based on real-world datasets also validate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed approach. </p>

<h2>Resource Pricing, and Demand Allocation</h2>
<p align="justify">For a cloud service provider, it necessitates an emerging cloud ecosystem to consolidate the existing users and attract more potential users, further gaining its market share. Therefore, in this paper, we design a price-incentive resource auction mechanism in cloud environment. In response to the cloud resource price, each user synthesizes her bidding budget and QoS requirement, and purchases cloud resources according to her resource demand in a strategic manner. The cloud service provider, meanwhile, can regulate the resource demands of users through conducting a market-oriented pricing strategy, against too low prices to cover the operational costs (i.e., energy costs) or too high prices resulting in user churn. In virtue of an elaborate market-based pricing strategy, the interests of users and the cloud service provider are balanced. Our price-incentive resource auction mechanism targets to either maximize the cloud service provider's service revenue, or stimulate maximum users willing to purchase resources and perform their applications at the cloud, on the premise of a minimum proﬁt rate guaranteed for the cloud service provider. It is also able to provide budge balance and truthfulness guarantee, and satisfy the envy-freeness. In order to carry out the above objectives, we carefully design the user utility function reﬂecting the complicated user interest, and formulate our resource pricing and auction problem as a bin packing problem, which has non-polynomial computational complexity. Regarding the NP-hardness of optimization problem and the non-convexity of user utility, we present the counterpart computational-efﬁcient heuristic algorithm. Finally, we conduct simulations based on real-world dataset to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>
