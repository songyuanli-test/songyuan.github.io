<h2>Service Selection, and Composition</h2>
<p align="justify">The increasing momentum of service-oriented architecture has led to the emergence of divergent delivered services, where service selection is meritedly required to obtain the target service fulfilling the requirements from both users and service providers. I target to fill the research gap in the case where service requests from multiple users are performed simultaneously by a certain set of shared candidate services, although many existing works have extensively handled the issue of service selection. Meanwhile, I consider the constraints enforced on the context of service selection, such as, service placement location and contracts between users and service providers. In this sense, I propose a QoS-aware service selection scheme with constraints from a fairness aspect, with the objective of achieving max-min fairness across multiple service requests. In specific, I formulate this problem as a lexicographical maximization problem, which is yet far from trivial to deal with practically due to its inherently multi-objective and discrete nature. Given this, I develop an efficient fairness-aware algorithm for concurrent service selection, whose basic idea is to iteratively solve the single-objective subproblems by transforming them into linear programming problems. This work has been published in the IEEE ICWS 2019.</p>

<h2>Resource Pricing, and Demand Allocation</h2>
<p align="justify">For a cloud service provider (CSP), it necessitates an emerging cloud ecosystem to both consolidate numerous cloud users and earn great revenue from users, further gaining its market share and achieving profitablity. Therefore, I design a price-incentive resource auction mechanism in cloud environment. In response to the cloud resource price, each user synthesizes her bidding budget and QoS requirement, and purchases cloud resources according to her resource demand in a strategic manner. The CSP, meanwhile, can regulate the resource demands of users through conducting a market-oriented pricing strategy, against too low prices to cover the operational costs or too high prices resulting in user churn. My proposed price-incentive resource auction mechanism targets to either maximize the CSP's service revenue, or stimulate maximum users willing to purchase cloud resources, on the premise of a minimum proﬁt rate guaranteed for the CSP. It is also expected to provide budge balance and truthfulness guarantee, and satisfy the envy-freeness. To carry out the above objectives, I define the user utility function reﬂecting the complicated user interest, and formulate our resource pricing and auction problem as a BP problem. Regarding the NP-hardness of optimization problem and the non-convexity of user utility, I present the counterpart computational-efﬁcient heuristic algorithm. The above work is presented in two research papers differentially standing in the place of cloud users or CSP, which are under review and respectively considered for acceptance in the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (TNSM, 1st-round review decision received), and the IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Enginerring (TNSE, to be submitted).</p>

<h2>Fog Computing, and Mobile Edge Computing</h2>
<p align="justify">With the increasing prevalence of online services mounted on IoT devices, edge computing gains signiﬁcant momentum over conventional cloud-centric architecture. Edge servers are geographically deployed in a distributed manner nearby IoT devices, which not only frees online services from the high hardware requirement but also sharply reduces network latency experienced by end users. Given this, I study the QoS evaluation and optimization issues with regard to the edge scenario, specifically covering the following five aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Design queueing network models for QoS evaluation of IoT services in edge-cloud systems, published in the International Journal of Web and Grid Services (IJWGS).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conduct reliability-aware QoS evaluation for recoverable IoT edge services using the modeling techniques of generalized stochastic Petri net (GSPN), presented in the IEEE SCC 2017.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manipulate the MDP-based resource allocation and task scheduling in edge computing paradigm weighing energy costs against QoS requirements, presented in the IEEE ISPA 2017.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Study the dynamic QoS-aware task scheduling and resource management problem in mobile edge computing by designing an efficient optimization algorithm with the effective and efficient LP relaxation techniques, published in the Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications (PPNA).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adopt the potential game theory to solve the edge resource allocation problem with Quality of Experience (QoE) maximization in a decentralized manner, currently submitted for peer-review in the IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC).</p>
